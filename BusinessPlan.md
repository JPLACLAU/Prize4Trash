Blockchain decentralized prize for collecting garbage

1. Executive summary

We seek to develop a decentralized network for trash collection that will provide incentives for cleaning urban and natural areas that are outside the current city plan or regional plan for garbage collection. A centralized local authority may have a slow response or no response at all when garbage is found in unexpected places. Therefore that garbage is not being taken care of according to any garbage collection plan and might be piling up and cause increasing problems for the healthy sustainability of the local environment.

This network also has the potential to be a job provider, thus enhancing the the financial sustainability of local communities as well.

2. Strategic overview

2.1. Key Terms

Vision: To become the world's leading alternative for cleaning up the trash found in unexpected places in nature or cities, through an innovative product design that consolidates the needs of numerous actors with an interest in long-term sustainability. Those different actors can be in touch with each other with capability for value transfer through our network.

Mission: To develop a P4T platform, “Price for trash”, which overcomes obstacles around incentives allocation for trash collection and the speed at witch this can happen, thus making the solution very fast compared to legacy centralized plans for trash collection. P4T will be available worldwide and will work both with legacy trash-gathering organizations but also can work independently of them. Thus making the network resilient and not dependent on any particular form of already established government.

2.2. Values:

• Care and understanding of local communities and their needs for long therm sustainability.

• Innovative integration between technology, people and their environment.

• Fast and efficient articulation between different actors provide resilient solutions.

Goals: To deliver a fast networking platform to local communities around the world. This will help them put a price tag on places where the garbage is being piled up and not being gathered thus providing an incentive for the collection of that abandoned garbage.

Objectives: Build a platform driven by blockchain technology to leverage the versatility of distributed ledger and smart contracts functionality. Design an easy to use, readily available solution which enables incentives for garbage collection in places where the current local system does not reach, or has a very slow response to the problem.

• Build the initial phase of the platform for a local community with a problem with garbage: Vicente Lopez Neighborhood, in the North of the city of Buenos Aires, has a persistent garbage problem on the shores of the Rio de la Plata River. More than 200.000 people live in this area and the shore with a garbage problem is 6km long. The trash comes from the river, there is no way to stop this problem as the origin is from places up the river, not from the neighborhood itself. And all the standard garbage collecting systems ignore what happens on the shoreline of the river, as the origin of the garbage being accumulated there is not from the people of that neighborhood. Sometimes volunteers are picking up the trash but with no reward and they just don’t do this frequently enough to keep the shoreline clean. The platform will be build during winter 2023 and we will begin the first test on spring 2023.

Vicente Lopez is the neighborhood of the founder of this project. More neighborhoods will be added as soon as other participants join this venture.

2.3 Type of Business Operations:

We seek to provide:

• Government-to-Government services: Our network will help and enhance already established garbage collection plans put in place by government entities.

• Business/individual-to-Government services: Our network will help and enhance the communication between people affected by the garbage problem and government entities that are in charge of garbage collection.

• Government-to-Business/individual services: Governments may put a prize on for some garbage collection and let businesses or individuals seeking a rented opportunity do the work.

• Business/individual-to-Business/individual services: The P4T platform can put incentives in society without the need for government intervention.

2.4. Problem Area

P4T aims to overcome significant problems related to non-expected garbage accumulation in urban and natural areas.

• Awareness problem: some people may notice there is garbage accumulation but don’t report it anywhere. With our network now they can report it.

• Urban gatherers rely only on recycling revenue, with our network now they can have another stream of revenue for collecting the garbage. This will incentivize them to pick up trash and clean a place that does not always have recycling potential.

• Some garbage accumulation sites are far away from where people are located. With our network, there is a path to create enough incentives so it is justified for some people to mobilize to the site and gather that trash.

2.5. Business Model Solution and revenue creation.

The project will become open source once it is mature, the revenue at that point for the maintenance and expansion of the network will come from the actors that place the prize tags for garbage collection. Each prize tag will have a % that will go directly to the worker or business collecting the garbage, a % that will go to the moderators, and a % that will go to the business in charge of the development and maintenance of the network. On the other side, the government and businesses interested in using the system can pay for a personalized version of this blockchain solution.

3 Competitive analysis

3.1 Summarized STEEPLE for the Macro-environment analysis

Socio-Cultural: P4T can widely widespread easily arround the world as long as there the area has internet mobile coverage as the users needs a mobile with internet connection to connect to the network.

Technology: The innovative use of blockchain technology will disrupt current garbage collection plans for the unespected trash accumulation sites. There is no modern competition for our solution.

Economic: The incentives that our network will allow to exist will create new revenue flow for existing actors in charge of garbage collection as well as stimulate the creation of new jobs and busineses that will want to earn those incentives.

Environment: It is a win win solution for the environment as our network is providing incentives for government, busineses and individual actors to pick up the trash on the environment and clean it up thus improving the sustainability of that area.

Political and Legal: There might be countries more open to some aspects of our network but closed to other aspects. Some goverments might nto want to lose control over the trash collection therefore will only accept our netowkr for regulated entities by the government. Some other countries might not want to lose time and effort with regulation and will simply let the non government actors involved will use the network as they see fit.

Ethical: We may encounter similar ethical questions as other networks involved in giving incentives to provide a service such as Uber. Questions might range from “is this a real job?”. As well as some garbage might be dangerous to be picked up by a non regulated actor. We will establish a criteria on what migh be ethical to put a prize on and what not to put a prize on.
