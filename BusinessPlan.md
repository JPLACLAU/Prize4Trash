garbage

1. Executive summary

We seek to develop a decentralized network for trash collection that will provide incentives for cleaning urban and natural areas that are outside the current city plan or regional plan for garbage collection. A centralized local authority may have a slow response or no response at all when garbage is found in unexpected places. Therefore that garbage is not being taken care of according to any garbage collection plan and might be piling up and cause increasing problems for the healthy sustainability of the local environment.

This network also has the potential to be a job provider, thus enhancing the the financial sustainability of local communities as well.

2. Strategic overview

2.1.1 Key Terms

Vision: To become the world's leading alternative for cleaning up the trash found in unexpected places in nature or cities, through an innovative product design that consolidates the needs of numerous actors with an interest in long-term sustainability. Those different actors can be in touch with each other with capability for value transfer through our network.

Mission: To develop a P4G platform, “Price for garbage”, which overcomes obstacles around incentives allocation for trash collection and the speed at witch this can happen, thus making the solution very fast compared to legacy centralized plans for trash collection. P4G will be available worldwide and will work both with legacy trash-gathering organizations but also can work independently of them. Thus making the network resilient and not dependent on any particular form of already established government.

Values:

• Care and understanding of local communities and their needs for long therm sustainability.

• Innovative integration between technology, people and their environment.

• Fast and efficient articulation between different actors provide resilient solutions.

Goals: To deliver a fast networking platform to local communities around the world. This will help them put a price tag on places where the garbage is being piled up and not being gathered thus providing an incentive for the collection of that abandoned garbage.

Objectives: Build a platform driven by blockchain technology to leverage the versatility of distributed ledger and smart contracts functionality. Design an easy to use, readily available solution which enables incentives for garbage collection in places where the current local system does not reach.

• Build the initial phase of the platform for a local community with a problem with garbage: Vicente Lopez Neighborhood, in the North of the city of Buenos Aires, has a persistent garbage problem on the shores of the Rio de la Plata River. More than 200.000 people live in this area and the shore with a garbage problem is 6km long. The trash comes from the river, there is no way to stop this problem as the origin is from places up the river, not from the neighborhood itself. And all the standard garbage collecting systems ignore what happens on the shoreline of the river, as the origin of the garbage being accumulated there is not from the people of that neighborhood. Sometimes volunteers are picking up the trash but with no reward and they just don’t do this frequently enough to keep the shoreline clean. The platform will be build during winter 2023 and we will begin the first test on spring 2023.

Vicente Lopez is the neighborhood of the founder of this project. More neighborhoods will be added as soon as other participants join this venture.

2.1.2 Type of Business Operations:

We seek to provide:

• Government-to-Governmen services: Our network will help and enhance already established garbage collections plans put in place by government entities.

• Government-to-Business services: Governments may put a prize on for some garabge collection and let business do the work. Those business might be from the size of only an individuals seeking a work opportunity or well established recicling and garbage collection business with many people working
